One of my goals for the new year was to contribute more to the development community. One way that I determined I could contribute was to author articles to provide insight on how to accomplish certain tasks.

The first step to achieving this goal was the creation of this web log. This means of communication is very effective and gets your ideas to a lot of people in an efficient manner.

Given this, I have finally contributed my first article to [codeproject.com][1]. The article is an introduction to authoring web services with the Microsoft .NET framework and Visual Studio .NET. The sample code associated with the article demonstrates a web service that retrieves the daily [Dilbert][2] image. You can view the article [here][2]. I'm very open to suggestions/comments on the article.

Its been just over a month since my first post and as I reflect back on the month that has passed, I've come to the conclusion that blogging at times can be difficult.

Granted that there are blogs like [Mark's][1] that people will visit all the time, the majority of blogs do not have that kind of readership. Blogging seems to me to be very similar to being a radio announcer. While you're first starting out, you never quite know for sure if there's anyone out there listening. 

The comment mechanism is similar to that of a radio announcer as well. Most people that listen to a radio station don't call and talk with the radio announcer. It seems as this is another similarity, as I would imagine that the majority of people visiting a specific blog will not leave comments.

Is this the reason why a lot of people start blogging and then stop shortly thereafter? Have you started a blog and then either took it down or stopped posting to it? If so, I'd like to hear why.

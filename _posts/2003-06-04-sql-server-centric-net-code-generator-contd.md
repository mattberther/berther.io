Olymars finally made [primetime][1] at Microsoft.com, who is now hosting it (as opposed to Microsoft France).

I talked previously about [my thoughts][2] on this product. Nice thing about this one is that now there is also a tutorial offered. Downloading now...

>SQL Server Centric .NET Code Generator (code named OlyMars) is both a flexible and powerful code generator based on database modeling.

>It allows instant generation of both SQL and .Net code providing a complete library of stored procedures, .NET classes and ready-to-use Windows/Web form controls (including associated documentation).

>SQL Server Centric .NET Code Generator is also fully extensible to use one's own custom templates and consequently can be adjusted to generate any custom code respecting a homogeneous implementation scheme within the company (can be written either in VB .NET or C# .NET).

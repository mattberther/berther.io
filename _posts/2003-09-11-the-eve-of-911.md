I've already run through the full gamut of emotions, including horror, sadness, anger and rage. Even though people say that time heals all wounds, this is one that I dont think we will ever completely recover from. Even though I didnt know anyone involved in the tragedy personally, this is something that hit everyone very close to home.

A lot of fantastic songs have come from this tragedy. Two of my favorites are Darryl Worley's [Have You Forgotten][1] and Toby Keith's [Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue][2].

> Man, we lit up your world

Let's never forget the people who died that day, and lets never forget the soldiers who have died since then protecting our freedoms that we cherish. Let's not forget the soldiers that are *still* out there fighting for us. I can guarantee they remember what they are fighting for.

Take a minute to tell the ones you love how much you love them. Pick up the phone and call that person with whom you've had a falling out with. Life is too short.

God bless America...

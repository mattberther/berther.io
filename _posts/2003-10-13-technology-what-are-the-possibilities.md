I just got finished helping Sage with some problems he encountered with installing MovablePoster. No issues with MovablePoster, thankfully.

We managed to get this done via MSN Instant Messenger. Im just completely taken aback by where technology has taken us. That I can sit in my office in Boise, Idaho and help him while he's sitting at his desk in Boston.

The other day, my boss accidentally hit the Audio button while we were having an IM conversation, and we managed to have a conversation that rivaled in quality a conversation that we would've had via phone.

I couldn't have imagined this five years ago. So, people sometimes ask... why are you in technology? This is why... I can't wait to see whats next.

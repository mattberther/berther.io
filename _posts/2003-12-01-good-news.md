About three years ago, I met a very special lady, who very quickly became my very best friend. Last June, Lindsay and I decided to take our friendship to the next level and started dating. 

Last Saturday night, I worked up the courage to ask her to be my wife, and without any reservation, she said yes.

Although the proposal did not go quite the way that I had planned, it is definitely a story we will remember. One of these days, I may talk her into letting me share it.

For those that are interested, the ring is "simple, but elegant". This is the term that I used when the saleslady asked me what I was looking for. It is a platinum band, with 4 baguettes and 3 rounds on each side, and an approximately 1 carat center diamond. It looks absolutely wonderful on her finger.

No firm date has been set yet, but we are looking towards fall 2004 or spring 2005, which will allow us plenty of time to enjoy each other and not get stressed out about planning a wedding.

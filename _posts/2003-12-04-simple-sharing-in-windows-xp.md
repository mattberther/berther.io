Robert McLaws [posts][1] about how to disable the simple sharing dialog in Windows XP.

Tools | Folder Options | View | Uncheck "Use Simple Sharing"

This has been driving me nuts for a while. Now, if I could only get my laptop (member of a domain at work), to be able to access the shares on my computer at home (which is just a part of a workgroup).

Everytime I try to access `\\machine-name\c$`, I can't enter a username. It just comes up with \\machine-name\Guest in a disabled textbox. ARGH!

Anyone know how to fix this?

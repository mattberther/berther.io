Scoble had an [interesting post][1] yesterday about group blogs such as PDC Blogs, .NET Weblogs and Longhorn Blogs.

I completely understand where he's coming from. I, too, have thought about moving my blog to one of these group blogs. The thought of having 7000+ visitors a day is very tempting.

Building traffic on this site has taken significantly longer than it would have on another site. I'm nowhere near Scoble's 1000-4000 visitors per day. I'm averaging 300-400 per day. However, I know that those 300-400 people are coming to read me. They find what *I* say interesting.

Ultimately, Im kind of a control freak. I like to write about what I want, when I want. I dont want to be kicked off of a group blog because I say something that the owner doesnt like. I want to be able to have the freedom to update the technology used for the content management system. I want to know that if my traffic declines, its because Im not interesting anymore.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not against the group blogs. On the contrary, I subscribe to each of the ones listed. I just dont think that they are a good match for what I want to accomplish.

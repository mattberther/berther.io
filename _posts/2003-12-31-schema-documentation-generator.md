[This service][1] can generate an easy-to-read XHTML documentation from an XSD schema.

Features include:

* links that allow you to jump to the referenced schema components
* sample XML of schema components' constraints
* glossary section which explains some schema terminology

You can also download this for use on your local system at the project Titanium [download page][2] (you will need an XSLT processor that supports W3C XSLT 1.0).

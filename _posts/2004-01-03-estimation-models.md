Steve Maine has another excellent post online about [estimation models][1], using "perfect engineering" (PE) hours as the baseline. A PE hour is what you have when you are in the zone, with no outside distractions (ie: meetings, email, IM, etc).

All of the variables that can then take you out of this "perfect engineering" zone are then factored in at a later time, giving much more accurate estimates.

The biggest thing to make this work though is that the estimate *has* to be developer driven. Sadly, in most organizations, this is still not the case.

This was forwarded to me by a friend, and I felt it necessary to share. The message behind this is quite powerful.

>Think of life as a juggling game where the juggler has five balls. Those balls are work, family, friends, health and integrity. If you happen to drop the ball of work, it will bounce back to you and you can resume for it is made of rubber. The others are made of crystal and are very fragile. If you drop one of them, it will shatter.

Consider these words throughout the new year and work to find a balance so that all the balls stay in the air, especially those that are fragile and can break.

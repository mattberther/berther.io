A few days ago, I stumbled across [NSIS][1], which is a tool that allows you to create installers for Microsoft Windows. It's released under an open source license and is completely free to use.

I really havent had that much time to work with it, but so far, I like what I see. If you do download this and check it out, make sure and get one of the editors for it. It definately makes things easier when you're getting started.

I'm noticing that the install and uninstall runs *so* much faster than the Installshield or VS.NET msi files that I have been using.

If you've used NSIS, Id love to hear what you think about it.

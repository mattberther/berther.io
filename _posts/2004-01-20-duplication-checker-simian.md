Earlier this week, I came across a really cool tool for checking and detecting duplicated code throughout a group of files.

[Simian][1], although written in Java, works very well for C# code and it is lighting fast. Output can be directed to the console, or to a file (in either plain, XML or EMacs formats). Included in the package is a basic stylesheet so that you can view your XML in a more meaningful way.

Current supported languages include:

* Java
* C#
* C++
* Javascript (ECMAScript)
* COBOL, ABAP
* Ruby
* JSP (partial)
* HTML (partial)
* XML (partial)
* Visual Basic (partial)

Simian has a free license available for non-commercial and open source user. If you need it in another capacity, different licenses are available, including a personal license for $29. What a small price to pay for the benefits of time saved performing maintenance, debugging and refactoring.

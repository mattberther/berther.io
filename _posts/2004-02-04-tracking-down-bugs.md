Chris Pratley has a gem of a post today discussing how Microsoft is [dealing with bugs][1]. His post is an excellent foray into why bugs are so hard to track down and the steps they are taking to resolve them.

He's even got a wonderful counter for the often-heard argument of how open source is much more secure because so many more people look at the code.

I had the pleasure of seeing [Rob Howard][1] speak at VSLive! in San Francisco about a month back, and really enjoyed his presentation. His knowledge of the materials he presented was absolutely amazing. Since then, I've made it a point to read anything he puts out, as the information provided is invaluable.

Yesterday, part 2 of his article on the [provider design pattern][2] became available on MSDN. The provider model will be introduced as part of the .NET 2.0 framework. This new article discusses how someone would go about implementing this provider model using the .NET 1.1 framework.

While the article only covers implementation of the MembershipProvider, it is very easy to see how it can be applied to the other providers, including the Personalization provider, so that you can start using these right away.

Great work, Rob.

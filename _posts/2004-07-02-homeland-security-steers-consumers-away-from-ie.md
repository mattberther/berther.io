This article on [Yahoo! News][1] is sure to cause quite a bit of controversy. 

>The Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team touched off a storm this week when it recommended for security reasons using browsers other than Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Explorer.

It will be interesting to hear Microsoft's position on this, since they've already lost a significant amount of their userbase. 

I've been using [Firefox][2] for almost a month now. I only go back to IE for the few pages that require it, such as the MSDN subscriber downloads site, whose treeview is unsupported by Firefox.

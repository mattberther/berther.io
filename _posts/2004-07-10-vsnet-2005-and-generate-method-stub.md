Visual Studio.NET 2005 introduces several handy refactorings, including Extract Interface and Extract Method.

One item on the menu is Generate Method Stub. The idea is that you can type a method name and then right click, select refactor and Generate Method Stub, and it would provide a stubbed method for you (throwing a NotImplementedException).

Can anyone answer why this is on the Refactoring menu?

While this is a superb feature, I'm still trying to figure out how this is related to refactoring. To me, this seems more like a tool to assist in new coding, whereas refactoring improves the design of existing code.

You know, it just seems like yesterday when my daughter, Sierra, was born. That was August 16, 1999. This morning, five years later, I had the opportunity to walk Sierra into her very first kindergarten class.

There was a little bit of separation anxiety on her part. Mostly, I think she was just nervous about all the new kids. However, she found one of her friends from ballet class and off she went. I'm really proud of her and am looking forward to watching her progress through her education.

I'll tell you what, it sure makes you feel old as your kids grow up...

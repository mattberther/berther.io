Christopher Hawkins has another great article online talking about how [professionalism means saying "No" sometimes][1].

This article is about sometimes having to say no to maintain a release schedule. Christopher talks about his experience with a client, and how it played out. Also, he cites Bill Gates in relation to the recent well-publicized [Longhorn cuts][2]. Only time will tell how that plays out.

My opinion: People dont remember if you ship late. They do, however, remember if you ship crap.

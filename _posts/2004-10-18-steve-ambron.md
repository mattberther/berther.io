I got a note today from a very good friend of mine. Steve and I have known each other for almost 14 years now. Several years back, Steve joined the Army and last November, he got called on by our country to serve in Iraq. He spent almost a year over there in the desert in conditions I cant even begin to imagine. 

His note today let me know that he was home at last, decompressing and spending time with his wife. 

I've repeatedly expressed my gratitude to Steve for doing what he does. We have the freedoms that we do because people like Steve stand up to protect our country. Regardless of your politics, I think everyone should thank a soldier for the sacrifices made on our behalf.

Thank you, Steve. You're my hero.

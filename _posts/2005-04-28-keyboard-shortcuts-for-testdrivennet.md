A frustration that I've had for quite some time with [TestDriven.NET][1] is the apparent lack of keyboard bindings. Right-click/Run Tests just seems like such a nuisance.

Today I set out to solve that problem...

Using the Tools | Options | Keyboard option in Visual Studio, you can assign keystrokes to the TestDriven.NET commands. The ones you're interested in are:

* TestDriven.NET.Client - runs the test cases on whatever the active item
* TestDriven.NET.Debugger - run in debugger option for the active item
* TestDriven.NET.Solution - Runs all tests in the current solution.

While spending last week in Las Vegas for VSLive!, we made a stop by [Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville]. Being a parrothead, this was quite a cool experience for me. During our visit there, I had a Tropical Hurricane, which although good was not quite like the Hurricanes that I've managed to whip up here.

I thought Id share the recipe for anyone interested:

* 2oz Bacardi Light
* 1oz Bacardi 151
* 1oz Captain Morgan's Parrot Bay Coconut Rum
* 1oz Rose's Lime
* 2oz Grenadine
* 8oz Pineapple-Orange juice
* 1/2 cup ice cubes

Combine all ingredients in a cocktail shaker, shake and serve in a hurricane glass garnished with orange. Be careful while enjoying; these are pretty lethal... :)

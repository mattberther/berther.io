School is not. I dont like the idea of schools telling you *what* to think, rather than teaching a person *how* to think.

I've long thought this to be true, and an essay by Micah Martin about [Jack and Jill][1] makes my point perfectly.

A person's desire to learn and how they learn means much more to me than any degree that person may or may not hold.

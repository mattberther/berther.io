Recently, a friend asked me a very interesting question: "What 3 to 5 attributes do you possess *as a person* that make you good at your job?"

At first, the question seems to ask what makes you good at your job, so you put down things like develop extensible applications and understands object oriented analysis and design. This is not what this person was after though, and what he was really looking for made me dig a lot deeper into myself to find the answer.

This is the list I came up with:

* Good communication
* Active learner
* Problem solver
* Confident
* Teacher

I cant wait to see what others put down and if there's a common thread among what makes a good developer.

Thanks for playing! :)

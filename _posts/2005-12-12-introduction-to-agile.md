Last week, our organization brought in [Robert Martin][1] to introduce our company to agile methodologies.

Mr. Martin was a very energentic and humorous speaker who has a clear passion about agile development. We started off the day with a 90 minute presentation at an executive level about the benefits of agile development. Mr. Martin used this time to very effectively detail the benefits of agile development to our leadership team. 

Later sessions offered more technical discussions on how to successfully deliver software using the agile methodologies such as TDD and continuous integration.

There's been quite a buzz here since this presentation and we're looking forward to proceeding with agile development now that we have the rest of the organization seemingly on board. Want an effective way to introduce agile to your organization? Id strongly recommend giving Mr. Martin's group [ObjectMentor][2] an opportunity.

My company, Healthwise, is going through a tremendous growth and we are looking at almost doubling our development staff. Part of my responsibilities for my new role as Software Engineering Manager include culling resumes to determine who makes it to the phone screening.

The quality, or lack thereof, of some of the resumes I've seen is astounding. As obvious as this sounds there is one thing that you can do to increase your chances of the resume making it further into the process.

Proofread your resume and cover letter. There is nothing that will make me reject your resume quicker than a resume or cover letter that has grammatical or typographical errors. If you can't take the time to make sure that you're submitting a quality product when applying for a job, how can I know that you will actually deliver quality for our organization.

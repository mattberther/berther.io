Tom McMahon has an absolutely epic post entitled '[What I have learned in 15 years][1]'. Tom shares what he has learned about life with a disabled son. This type of post epitomizes what blogging is all about.

Make sure you take a few minutes to read this. It certainly does put things into perspective.

One of my colleagues, Alex Mueller, recently completed a set of presentations to our organization which talked about the tenets of object oriented programming. Most of the people in the room were familiar with the concepts covered, however, I think that it's always good to go back and revisit the fundamentals.

He's taken his presentations and created a nice set of posts on his blog. I'd encourage everyone to go read them. What I have found is that when I go back and revisit things that I've used quite a bit, I always tend to learn something new or remember something that I may have forgotten.

* [What is an object?][1]
* [What is a class?][2]
* [What is inheritance?][3]
* [What is encapsulation?][4]
* [What is polymorphism?][5]
* [What is composition?][6]
* [What is abstraction?][7]

Thanks for a great series, Alex...

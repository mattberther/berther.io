Recently, I came across this gem from Martin Fowler's site called "[It's Not Just Standing Up: Patterns for Daily Stand-up Meetings][1]". If your stands up are starting to hit a rut, you will definitely want to read this article.

Some of my favorite parts of this article:

>Good stand-ups will feel **supportive**. When people are knocked down every time they raise a problem, they will tend to stop raising problems. Beyond preventing removal of obstacles, a non-supportive stand-up works against team dynamics. The stand-up instead becomes a ritual that team members dread.

>Regular interruption by observers is very disruptive to the delivery team by challenging the premise that the daily stand-up is primarily for the delivery team. Interruption also threatens *Fifteen Minutes or Less*. Enforce *Pigs and Chickens*.

I *love* this article. Absolutely recommended.

I've been talking a lot lately on this blog about using Scrum for project management. Some feedback that I've been getting is what is this Scrum thing, and how can I learn more about it or implement it.

Rather than trying to explain it third hand to you, I think it would be best if I shared a link to [Ken Schwaber's introduction to Scrum][1]. It's an hour long presentation, which is time well spent if you want to learn more about it or (in my case) want to learn best practices for implementing Scrum.

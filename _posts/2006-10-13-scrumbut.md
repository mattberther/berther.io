From [Eric Gunnerson][1]:

>I call that phenomena "Scrumbut". It shows up in the following way:
> "*We're doing Scrum but...*"  

>* *our sprints are 12 weeks long...*
>* *we do two normal sprints and one bugfix sprint...*
>* *we do all our planning up front...*
>* *we skip the daily meeting...*
>* *our managers decide what's in each sprint...*
>* *we haven't read the books yet...*
>* *our team has 30 people...*

I think this is actually wildly common. What ends up happening is that people get interested in an idea or technology, and as is typical, you learn enough about that idea to get started, without understanding it completely.

Inevitably, what happens, is that people get pissed off and write off an idea or technology as bad, when the true problem is that they didnt bother to learn enough about it to make it work.

That said... Want to avoid the "scrumbut" phenomena? I strongly recommend [this video][2] and [this book][3]. However, that should be the start of your journey. If you want to implement Scrum or for that matter, any new technology or idea, make sure that you're constantly learning more about it.

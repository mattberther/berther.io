Having just recently installed Vista RC2 as my main operating system on my laptop, I resolved to give Internet Explorer a fair shake to try and win me back as a user with version 7.

IE lost that battle after about 4 days of use. Recently, I discovered Google Reader and have really come to depend on it to read my RSS feeds. For whatever reason, IE just did not play nice with this application. The slow response time and piss-poor javascript performance is what finally did it in. I could deal with the occasional hiccup that caused my feeds to display incorrectly, or the occasional fart that skipped backwards when I hit next. The performance however was the last straw.

I've just installed Firefox 2.0 on this RC2 installation, and everything seems right in the world again... Other than the fact that Im still running it in Windows.

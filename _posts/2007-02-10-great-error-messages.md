Lately, it seems like at least once or twice a day, I get a great little error message when I load up google reader. It simply says, "Oops! That wasn't supposed to happen." Isn't that a fantastic, reassuring message? 

Stikkit's error page says something along the lines of "infernal server error" and "erp. The server burped processing your request". 

Good to see a little humour, but still in what I would almost consider critical applications, I'm not sure Im in the mood for an "oops" and a "burp". I just want to know that my data is ok.

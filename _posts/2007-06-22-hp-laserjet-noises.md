Not long ago, we bought an [HP Color LaserJet 2605dn][1] printer for our home office. Our experience with this printer has been absolutely fantastic, with one exception. If the printer had been sitting inactive for a while, and you send it a print job the printer would make this horrible squealing noise while printing the first page.

I was so baffled by what was causing this noise that I ended up calling HP about it. Their recommendation was that this was very unlikely, and that I should return it to the vendor for an exchange. I did this, and you can imagine my surprise when the new printer exhibited exactly the same behaviour.

After looking around the support forums and finding nothing, I thought that maybe this was some sort of a warning indicator noise. All at once, it hit me... It must be a power warning. This made sense, as all my peripherals were plugged into the same surge protector.

Eagerly, I moved the printer into its own outlet and sent a print job. There was no squealing. In fact, there has been no squealing from the printer for the past 3 or 4 weeks since I stumbled on this.

Now, this printer is absolutely perfect. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this printer to anyone that is looking for a high powered, network-ready color laser printer.

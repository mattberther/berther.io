I really have a wide taste in music and can listen to most anything for at least a little bit. For the most part though, I've always enjoyed music in the hard rock genre more than other genres. That changed not long ago, after I was introduced to [Josh Ritter][1]. 

Josh is a musician from right here in Idaho and currently, my favorite artist. If I had to describe his music, I would have to say minimalist with a very strong emphasis on lyrical content. Josh is an exceptional poet, a modern day Jim Morrison. Josh is able to craft hauntingly, beautiful lyrics. None of his lyrics are more mesmerizing than Thin Blue Flame ([free mp3][2]). Here's a sample:

>Borders soft with refugees  
>Streets a' swimming with amputees  
>It's a bible or a bullet they put over your heart  
>It's getting harder and harder to tell them apart  
>Days are nights and the nights are long  
>Beating hearts blossom into walking bombs  
>And those still looking in the clear blue sky for a sign  
>Get missiles from so high they might as well be divine  

>Now the wolves are howling at our door  
>Singing bout vengeance like it's the joy of the Lord  
>Bringing justice to the enemies not the other way round  
>They're guilty when killed and they're killed where they're found  
>If what's loosed on earth will be loosed up on high  
>It's a Hell of a Heaven we must go to when we die
  
>Where even Laurel begs Hardy for vengeance please  
>The fat man is crying on his hands and his knees  
>Back in the peacetime he caught roses on the stage  
>Now he twists indecision takes bourbon for rage  
>Lead pellets peppering aluminum  
>Halcyon, laudanum and opium  

>Sings kiss thee hardy this poisoned cup  
>His winding sheet is busy winding up  
>In darkness he looks for the light that has died  
>But you need faith for the same reasons that its so hard to find  
>And this whole thing is headed for a terrible wreck  
>And like a good tragedy that's what we expect 

There's so much more to this song; essentially a diary of what's been going on in our world for the past year. This song could easily be used for a college level study of the English language. Every time I listen to this song, I pick up yet another reference from it and find myself learning more and more about it. This song has spoken to me much more than any other song I can remember.

The rest of Josh's current CD, entitled "[The Animal Years][3]", is equally impressive, from the haunting introduction via 'The Girl in the War', to beautiful a cappella ballads like 'Idaho'. This album has it all and presents it in a very dramatic and&nbsp;melodic fashion. Very highly recommended. Josh's new CD "[The Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter][4]" will be publicly available on August 21 (available for preorder now). This promises to be a very solid sequel to Animal Years.</p>

I moderate all comments posted to this site to protect readers from inappropriate content. One of the best spam comments I've seen came through my email box earlier.

> hello , my name is Richard and I know  you get a lot of spammy comments ,I can help you with this problem . I know a lot of spammers and I will ask them not to post on your site. It will reduce the volume of spam by 30-50% .In return Id like to ask you to put a link to my site on the index page of your site. The link will be small and your visitors will hardly notice it , its just done for higher rankings in search engines. Contact me icq 454528835 or write me tedirectory(at)yahoo.com , i will give you my site url and you will give me yours  if you are interested. thank you

The best part of this is that the comment was posted to one my most spammed posts, so I can't help but wonder if this was a comment from the spammer himself. The extortion attempt is a nice touch.

By the way, Richard, you made my index page. Probably not the way you wanted, but nonetheless. As far as your offer goes, thanks, but no thanks. [Akismet][1] seems to be serving me just fine, thank you.

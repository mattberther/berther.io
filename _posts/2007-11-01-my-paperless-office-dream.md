... is a little closer to reality. My new [Fujitsu ScanSnap S510M][1] showed up, and I've spent some time getting through my file cabinets and clearing out a bunch of clutter. So far, I've managed to scan and shred about 18 inches of paper. My workflow at this time uses [DevonThink Pro Office][2], which offers a seamless integration with the ScanSnap. I load the document into the ScanSnap, push a button, and a few seconds later, I have a fully searchable PDF in my DevonThink database. 

The ScanSnap is a little expensive, but knowing what I know now, I only wish I would not have waited this long. It does not get much easier than this.

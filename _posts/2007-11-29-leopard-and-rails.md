Apple's latest OSX offering has both Ruby and Ruby on Rails built into the framework. Although, as I've discovered, some of the rails gems are rather outdated. To make sure you're playing with the latest, make sure to execute this:

``` console
sudo gem update rails
```

This will get RJS among other things from the recent version of Rails working correctly on Leopard.

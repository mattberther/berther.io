A daily scrum meeting involves asking each participant of the scrum team three questions:

1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What will you do today?
3. Is there anything in your way?

I've found that very rarely do people offer anything to the "is there anything in your way" question. After all, we are all engineers and there should be nothing in our way that we can not solve. 

I've started asking this question slightly differently. The question I ask now is: "Is there anything you need help with?" I've noticed that this question tends to spawn a discussion among the team members much more than the previous question. I am not quite sure why this is, but so far it seems to be working.

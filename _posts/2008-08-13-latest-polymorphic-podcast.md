Am I the only one that was bothered by Craig Shoemaker's [interview with Craig Newmark][1] (craigslist.org)? I was very put off my Mr. Newmark using almost 10 minutes of a 22 minute podcast to stump for Barack Obama. For this podcast, I was interested in learning more about the scaling model for craigslist and what made it a success. Unfortunately, this discussion seemed to get lost in the politics.

I try to stay away from politics on this blog, and I wish that it would also be removed from my other sources of technical information. 

Mr. Shoemaker: I enjoy the [Polymorphic Podcast][2] and have been a listener since episode 1. Please remember the mission of this podcast, and stay away from presenting highly charged political views on a technology podcast. I'll get my political news from other sources. Thank you.

About 10:00 last night, it became apparent that the people of the United States had spoken. They had spoken very clearly that they were ready for the change that Barack Obama was promising. In a very decisive election, Barack Obama has been elected the 44<sup>th</sup> President of the United States.

I'd like to congratulate Mr. Obama on a very effective campaign and his ability to appeal to the people of this nation. While I strongly oppose Mr. Obama's position on almost everything, I do submit to the wisdom of the greater collective. This is now an opportunity for all of us to come together. It is crucial to avoid taking a stance of "Don't Blame Me" or "Not My President". 

The next four years are going to be very challenging for our country. With a staggering economic crisis and two unfinished wars, President-elect Obama is inheriting a nation in turmoil, but with our support, we may be able to turn things around. As Mr. McCain said last night, we must support Mr. Obama when he is correct, challenge him when we believe he is wrong, and trust in his decisions.

God bless America.
